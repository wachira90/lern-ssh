To configure SSH on an Ubuntu system to force the use of ED25519 key type for login, you can follow these steps:

1. Edit the SSH server configuration file:

```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

2. Add or modify the following lines:

```
HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-ed25519
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes ssh-ed25519
```

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

4. Restart the SSH service:

```
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

5. Generate an ED25519 key pair on the client machine if you haven't already:

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

6. Copy the public key to the server:

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@server
```

7. Test the connection:

```
ssh user@server
```

This configuration will force the server to only accept ED25519 keys for public key authentication. Make sure you have a valid ED25519 key pair before applying these changes, or you might lock yourself out of the server.

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?
